# Credit Card Fraud Detection System with Random Forest

## Overview

This project implements a credit card fraud detection system using the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. The system analyzes historical credit card transaction data to identify potential fraudulent activities.

## Getting Started

To use this system, follow the instructions provided below.

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the notebooks)

### Installation

 Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AnalyticalShivam/credit_card_fraud_detection.git
   ```

## Usage

1. Explore the Jupyter notebooks available in the `notebooks`  for comprehensive steps on data analysis, preprocessing, model training (including Random Forest), and evaluation.
2. Utilize provided scripts for training Random Forest models or predicting on new data.


## Random Forest Model

The Random Forest model is implemented and trained for credit card fraud detection. The trained models are saved in the `models` directory.

## Evaluation

The Random Forest model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Detailed evaluation results can be found in the notebooks or in the `evaluation` directory.
